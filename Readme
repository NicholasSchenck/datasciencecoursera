# run_Analysis.R will:
# * Download the file 
# * Load tables
# * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# * I had difficulty on the last step getting means for each group, so the remaining averages were calculated using the Merged dataset outside of R
